Why was PeterGotKicks created?

Growing up, I've always been passionate about sneakers and the sneaker culture, especially Air Jordans. Now, as an adult in college, I still carry that same passion. Combining it with my newfound passion in Software Engineering Using technical skills like HTML/CSS, JS, Node/Express .js, RESTapi, and sneaker knowledge, I've created a website that young Peter could only dream ofâ€”PeterGotKicks

Developed a dynamic sneaker database website, resulting in a user-friendly platform that allows visitors to view detailed information about various sneaker models, by leveraging Express.js and Node.js for server-side routing and handling HTTP requests and HTML/CSS and JavaScript for the User Interface.

Implemented a product pricing feature using the  RestAPI's, which increased the website's functionality by providing real-time price comparisons from different Resell Marketplaces including StockX, Goat, and FlightClub, enhancing the user's decision-making process, saving over $100 per model.

Enhanced website performance and user experience by utilizing Express.js static middleware for serving static files, leading to faster load times and improved website responsiveness.
Deployed the website using Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and Serverless Functions, ensuring high availability and scalability of the application, leading to a seamless user experience.
